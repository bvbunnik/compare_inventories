The system uses agent-based modelling based on census-based synthetic populations that capture the demographic and geographic distributions of the population, as well as detailed household, school, and workplace social networks. Multiple circulating and evolving strains can be simulated. Mitigation strategies in the framework include vaccination, anti-viral drugs, and school closure policies. FRED supports models of health behaviour change to facilitate the study of critical personal health behaviours such as vaccine acceptance, personal hygiene and spontaneous social distancing. FRED is available through open source in the hopes of making large-scale agent-based epidemic models more useful to the policy-making community, the research community, and as a teaching tool for students in public health.",
